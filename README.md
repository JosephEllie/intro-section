## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I built the landing page using components

### Built with

- React
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCss] (https://tailwindcss.com/)

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Breakpoints in Tailwind

<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>
```
  <div className="flex md:hidden ">
        <img src={heroMobile} alt="" />
      </div>
      <div className="hidden md:flex">
        <img src={heroDesktop} alt="" style={{ width: 550, height: 700 }} />
      </div>
  <img src={databiz} alt="" width={70} className="md:w-[100]" />
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more on responsiveness

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me in doing layouts and styling my elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) - Tailwind Ui is responsive and pretty awesome, I used the nav component and then styled it to my liking. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
